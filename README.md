#Caesar Cipher Program

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This script allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.

Features
->Encrypt: Encode a message by shifting the letters a specified number of positions.
->Decrypt: Decode a message by reversing the shift.
->Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

How It Works
The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter of the input message by a fixed number of positions (also known as the shift value). The shift can be positive (for encryption) or negative (for decryption).

For example, with a shift of 3:

Plaintext: HELLO
Encrypted: KHOOR
The program allows users to:

Choose between encryption or decryption.
Input the message and the shift value.
